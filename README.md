# DigitalForensicToolkit

Description
This document comprises an alphabetical  list of tools learned about and used throughout a semester of a digital forensics course:
* __Autopsy__ - Forensics tool used to analyse OS images. Through Autopsy deleted files and drive partitions can be viewed. I found this easier to use than FTK and it has the plus of not having to manage user access keys. https://www.sleuthkit.org/autopsy/
* __BPF__ - Berkeley Packet Filter, a Unix tool used to analyze raw network traffic at the data link layer. It’s built into wireshark.
Event Viewer - Windows tool that can be used to easily view Windows and application logs, which can be filtered at various levels. https://www.howtogeek.com/123646/htg-explains-what-the-windows-event-viewer-is-and-how-you-can-use-it/
* __Forensics Toolkit (FTK)__ - An enterprise digital forensics tool used to comb files on a harddrive. It’s a competitor to Autopsy. It has the benefit of being able to drill deeper into files such as emails and documents, which autopsy lacks. I won’t include a link for this tool because a key is needed to use it.
* __Grep__ - A command-line utility that stands for globally search a regular expression and print. Grep searches within files and filesystem paths. Grep has variants such as egrep (ERE) and fgrep for fixed strings (not regex). Grep understands three different versions of regular expression syntax: “basic” (BRE), “extended” (ERE) and “perl” (PCRE).  In GNU, there is no difference in available functionality between basic and extended syntaxes.http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/grep.1.html
* __Nmap__ - Network Mapper, Nmap is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses.
* __OSXpmem__ - OSXpmem is a part of the pmem suite created by the developers of Rekall. Rekall is a utility built for both memory acquisition and live memory analysis on Windows, Linux, and OSX systems. https://ponderthebits.com/2017/02/osx-mac-memory-acquisition-and-analysis-using-osxpmem-and-volatility/
* __Sklearn__ - A python library used for basic machine learning algorithms. This is one of the most widely used machine learning platforms. You can solve most classification or regression problems using this tool. We used this to predict password strength using a list of over 2 million passwords. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/
* __Snort__ - snort is an intrusion detection system used to monitor networks. Similar to Wireshark, you can use snort to drill into packets and monitor patterns. We tried to use snort to detect malware in a pcap file, but were unable to obtain results. https://www.snort.org/
* __Suricata__ - an open source, high performance computer network intrusion detection system, IPS and Network Security Monitoring engine. https://suricata.readthedocs.io/en/suricata-4.1.5/what-is-suricata.html
* __TCPDump__ - A command-line tool that prints the contents of network packets. It can read packets from a network interface card or from a previously created saved packet file.
* __Volatility__ - A platform of command line tools that can execute commands to observe OS image files. In our class we used this to look into Windows Vista and XP images; though it works with Linux also. We then used Volatility to run commands such as pstree, connections, netlist, etc to find malware that might have infected the image. This is a great tool for any forensics operation involving machine images. https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility
* __WinPrefetchView__ - Windows application that shows prefetch file information: app run counters, last run time, path of process exe file, DLL files associated with it. https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/win_prefetch_view.html
* __WireShark__ - Packet logging and analysis tool. You can view packet headers and content and drill as far as you want into most known packet types. In the world of forensics, you can use this for capturing packets and monitoring suspicious connections, filtering on ip address or connection protocol. You can listen to connections, or simply load pcap files. https://www.wireshark.org/
* __Yara__ - A malware detection tool. It uses user written rules to observe strings and binary patterns and output detected patterns. So you could write a rule to find a particular sequence that is commonly found in a certain malware file. You might then run yara on a list of files to determine if they might contain malware. https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara
